## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<br>

<div align="center"><h3>My name is Frank Bruzzone and I am an aspiring developer</h3></div>

<br>
<br>

 Currently  I am working on an app that will utilize **machine learning/TensorFlow** to implement speech-to-text as a means for ordering items from bodegas in the New York City area. It will be able to utilize recording audio from users utilizing the speech-to-text feature from a web browser on mobile devices. So far the stack includes:
 - Svelte on the front end
 - Firebase for the backend/database
 
<br>

I am always trying to learn new things and improve my skills as a developer. If you are looking to collaborate, feel free to reach out!
