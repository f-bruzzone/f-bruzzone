### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<br>

<div align="center"><h3>My name is Frank Bruzzone and this is my personal github that I started using when I first stated learning web development</h3></div>

<br>
<br>

The repos show somewhat of a journey of my experience learning web development after I had graduated from school. They're a collection of some of the things I've done along the way to becoming a full time professional developer, as well as recently some side projects for where I want to branch out towards in the future. 
 
<br>

I am always trying to learn new things and improve my skills as a developer. If you are looking to collaborate, feel free to reach out!
