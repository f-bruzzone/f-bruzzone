### My name is Frank Bruzzone and I am a professional web developer as of around 2021. 

<br>

I work primarily with C# in .NET these days, but have done a lot of frontend work in the past with Javascript/Angular. In my free time I'm interested in learning all kinds of things, with a stronger
interest focused around games. I have spent a decent amount of time using Unity and a bit less time with Unreal. And most recently I have begun learning graphics programming with C++. I'm starting
this with OpenGL, but I do plan on trying out other graphics API's in the future. 
 
<br>

I am always trying to learn new things and improve my skills as a developer. If you are looking to collaborate, feel free to reach out!
